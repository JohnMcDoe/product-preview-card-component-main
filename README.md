## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- Mobile-first workflow

### What I learned

I learnt how to create even columns with Flexbox. I also learnt how to use media queries, and with that about the picture tag which lets you switch image sources depending on how you set its 'srcset' and 'media' attributes.

### Continued development

Even though my solution resembles the design, I couldn't figure out how to remove the overflow which happens when the window gets too small. I'd like the content to shrink instead of disappearing at the sides.

### Useful resources

- [MDN Web Docs](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/)
- [Kevin Powell Youtube Channel](https://www.youtube.com/@KevinPowell/featured) - High-quality content creator who mainly produces videos about CSS. Highly recommend his channel if you want to learn CSS.
